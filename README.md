# Vaultd website

The stuff that powers vaultdstorage.com, in less than half a megabyte (as of February)

## How to edit

To make changes, please test all work in your own branch and make a pull request. Please do not make requests without opening descriptive issues first or that are unrelated to issues. Feel free to open as many issues as you would like.

Do not edit bootstrap or jquery or other library code.

## Style

For js code, please follow http://nodeguide.com/style.html

Php is pretty much hopeless. Try to use good variable names.

Please read through utils.php and understand why those functions exist and when to use them before working on any server-side code
